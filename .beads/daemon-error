DATABASE MISMATCH DETECTED!

This database belongs to a different repository:
  Database repo ID:  0dbe6f47
  Current repo ID:   f15debaa

This usually means:
  1. You copied a .beads directory from another repo (don't do this!)
  2. Git remote URL changed (run 'bd migrate --update-repo-id')
  3. Database corruption
  4. bd was upgraded and URL canonicalization changed

⚠️  CRITICAL: This mismatch can cause beads to incorrectly delete issues during sync!
   The git-history-backfill mechanism may treat your local issues as deleted
   because they don't exist in the remote repository's history.

Solutions:
  - If remote URL changed: bd migrate --update-repo-id
  - If bd was upgraded: bd migrate --update-repo-id
  - If wrong database: rm -rf .beads && bd init
  - If correct database: BEADS_IGNORE_REPO_MISMATCH=1 bd daemon
    (Warning: This can cause data corruption and unwanted deletions across clones!)

# Retention Loops

## Overview
The app should create daily and weekly reasons to return, plus social moments worth sharing. These loops prioritize low friction (quick reads), emotional payoff (feels seen), and memory (remembers past entries and chats).

## Loop 1: Daily Check-In (Core)
**Trigger**: New day / feed refresh / user opens app
**Action**: Read personalized transit + quick prompt
**Reward**: Feeling seen, clarity for the day, a clean interaction

Flow:
1) Open app -> top feed item is personal transit insight.
2) One-tap "Tell me more" -> chat expands with context.
3) Optional diary prompt (daily/weekly/off; weekly default).
4) AI reflection (optional) links entry to current transit.
5) Save entry to memory; show "this relates to last week" callback.

Retention hooks:
- Streak light (optional; not required for MVP)
- "New today" chip on feed
- Short, skimmable items (2-3 lines)

## Loop 2: Personal Archive (Memory)
**Trigger**: User asks about a situation, or revisits old chats
**Action**: AI references prior entries and chat summaries
**Reward**: Feels known; sees patterns across time

Flow:
1) User asks a question in chat.
2) AI cites prior notes ("you mentioned this in October...")
3) AI suggests a recap or a quick timeline view.
4) User sees their evolution; adds another entry.

Retention hooks:
- Monthly recap card in feed
- "Memory surfaced" callout in chat
- User-controlled memory deletion

## Loop 3: Social + Culture (Tea Feed)
**Trigger**: Pop culture event or daily feed update
**Action**: Read short celeb astro take; optionally share
**Reward**: Social currency + entertainment

Flow:
1) Feed shows celebrity/culture astrology take.
2) User shares to socials or sends to friends.
3) New users join or return for next drop.

Retention hooks:
- "Hot today" tag
- Share button + auto-generated preview
- Limited daily slots to create scarcity

## Loop 4: Relationship Lens
**Trigger**: User adds a person or asks about a relationship
**Action**: Compatibility read + what-to-watch
**Reward**: Emotional clarity; curiosity to check again

Flow:
1) Add boyfriend/bestie/situationship (sun sign or full data).
2) Receive compatibility + near-term transit note.
3) Save to relationship thread; update when transits change.

Retention hooks:
- "New energy this week" callouts
- Relationship-specific feed tiles

## Optional Loop (Later): Prediction Markets
**Trigger**: Community daily polls or major events
**Action**: Vote/bet with credits
**Reward**: Game-like payoff + social bragging

Flow:
1) Daily poll appears in feed or chat.
2) User votes; sees how others voted.
3) Results resolve; credits awarded.

Retention hooks:
- Daily poll notification
- Public leaderboard (optional)

## MVP Notes
- Prioritize Loop 1 + 2 (daily check-in and memory).
- Loops 3 + 4 are lightweight additions (feed + relationships).
- Prediction markets are future phase only.

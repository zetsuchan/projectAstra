# Product Foundation

## North Star

### Mission
Build an astrology companion that feels like a best friend in chat, remembers your life, and makes astrology fun, useful, and aesthetically beautiful.

### Product Promise
A personalized, memory-rich astrology experience that users can rely on for perspective when life feels messy, while staying fun, culturally current, and easy to share.

### Success Criteria (V1)
- Launch a polished web + iOS experience within ~2 months.
- Core loop works end-to-end: onboarding -> chat -> diary -> feed -> return visit.
- Users can save chats/diary and see consistent memory in later conversations.
- The app feels premium: typography, layout, and overall visual system are intentionally designed.
- Privacy is credible and understandable to users (clear controls + deletion).

## Target Audience & Positioning

### Primary Persona
Chronically online girlies (TikTok-native, pop culture fluent), ages ~10-30, who are into astrology as both self-reflection and entertainment. They want a companion that is smart, witty, and emotionally validating without being clinical.

Traits:
- Social-first: shares hot takes, memes, and astro commentary.
- Style-aware: notices typography, layout, polish.
- Willing to make micro-payments for fun, emotionally resonant moments.
- Wants astrology that teaches as it reads (learns while being read).

### Secondary Personas
- Men and non-girl audiences who still want the same astro bestie experience.
- Curious beginners who know only sun sign but want to go deeper over time.

### Positioning Statement
For chronically online astrology fans who want a best-friend vibe, this app is a memory-rich astrology companion with a daily feed and personal diary that teaches and reads your chart over time. Unlike generic horoscope apps, it remembers your story, adapts to your knowledge level, and feels culturally alive.

### Voice & Tone (Initial)
- Sharp, playful, warm, sex-positive.
- Edgy (5/5), but brand-safe in marketing and UI labels.
- Can talk about relationships, sex, and real life without sounding clinical or mystical.

### Notes / Risks
- The stated age range includes minors. If we keep explicit conversation tone, we may need age gating (18+) or stricter content guardrails.
